## üìå Project Overview
This project is an intelligent Hiring Assistant chatbot developed for **"TalentScout"**, a fictional recruitment agency.  
Built with **Python, Streamlit, and Google‚Äôs Gemini Pro LLM**, the chatbot serves as an **initial screening tool** to efficiently gather essential candidate information and pose relevant technical questions based on their declared tech stack.

The application is designed with a **robust Python-managed state machine architecture**, ensuring a reliable and coherent conversational flow. It leverages the LLM for its strengths in **natural language understanding and generation** while relying on Python for **logic and state control**.

## üöÄ Key Capabilities
- **Resume Parsing** ‚Äì Allows candidates to upload a PDF resume to automatically pre-fill their information, saving time and improving user experience.  
- **Conversational Information Gathering** ‚Äì Collects candidate details (name, contact info, experience, etc.) in a natural, sequential flow.  
- **Dynamic Technical Question Generation** ‚Äì Creates **5 technical questions** tailored to the candidate's stated experience level and specific tech stack.  
- **Input Validation** ‚Äì Ensures data quality by validating formats for email, phone number, and years of experience, re-prompting the user if the input is invalid.  
- **Confirmation Step** ‚Äì Allows candidates to review and confirm all their details before the screening concludes, enhancing data accuracy.  
- **Automated Recruiter Summary** ‚Äì Generates a concise summary of the candidate's profile for a hiring manager upon completion of the screening.  
- **Progress Indicator** ‚Äì Keeps the user engaged by visually showing their progress through the screening process.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage Guide

1. **Start the Application** ‚Äì Upon launching, the chatbot will greet you and present two options.  
2. **Resume Upload (Optional)** ‚Äì Upload your resume (PDF) to have the chatbot automatically parse and pre-fill your details like name, email, and tech stack.  
3. **Manual Data Entry** ‚Äì If you choose to fill out the form manually, the chatbot will guide you through a series of questions one by one. The progress bar at the bottom will track your completion.  
4. **Confirmation** ‚Äì Once all information is collected, the chatbot will display a summary of your details and ask for confirmation. You can type `"yes"` to proceed or `"no"` to correct a specific field.  
5. **Technical Questions** ‚Äì After confirmation, the chatbot will generate and display **5 technical questions** tailored to your experience and skills.  
6. **Completion** ‚Äì The screening is now complete. A final summary for the recruiter will be generated and displayed in the sidebar.

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- Built on a **Python-Managed State Machine architecture**.  
- Python fully controls conversation flow, `st.session_state`, and business logic.  
- The LLM is used as a **stateless tool** for tasks such as:  
  - Natural Language Understanding (information extraction)  
  - Natural Language Generation (creating questions & summaries)  
- This approach proved more reliable than using the LLM for state management.  

### Libraries Used
- **streamlit** ‚Äì Interactive web UI  
- **google-generativeai** ‚Äì Official SDK for Google Gemini models  
- **PyPDF2** ‚Äì Extract text from uploaded resumes  
- **python-dotenv** ‚Äì Manage environment variables  
- **re** ‚Äì Regular expression-based validation  
- **time** ‚Äì Delay handling for API calls  

### LLM Model
- **Gemini-1.5-Flash** from Google AI Studio  
- Chosen for **balanced performance**, **quality output**, and **free-tier quotas**, making it responsive and cost-effective.

## üß† Prompt Design

### Resume Parsing Prompt
- **Purpose** ‚Äì Extract structured data from resume text.  
- **Design** ‚Äì LLM instructed to act as an expert resume parser and return a **valid JSON object** with required keys.  
  - Output is predictable and easy for Python to parse.  

### Conversational Extraction Prompt
- **Purpose** ‚Äì Extract candidate information from free-text responses.  
- **Design** ‚Äì Focuses on the current question but can also capture extra details if provided.  
  - Works alongside Python fallback for very simple inputs.  

### Technical Question Generation Prompt
- **Purpose** ‚Äì Generate relevant and appropriately challenging technical questions.  
- **Design** ‚Äì Dynamically created by injecting `years_experience` and `tech_stack` into the prompt.  
  - Ensures tailored difficulty (e.g., senior Python dev vs junior React dev).

## ‚ö° Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: LLM State Hallucination
- **Problem** ‚Äì LLM often forgot previously collected info, causing repeated questions.  
- **Solution** ‚Äì Moved state management fully to **Python (`st.session_state`)**.  
  - LLM only used for extraction & generation.  

### Challenge 2: Failure on Simple Inputs
- **Problem** ‚Äì LLM failed on direct inputs (e.g., `"3"` for years of experience).  
- **Solution** ‚Äì Implemented **‚ÄúTrust but Verify‚Äù fallback**.  
  - If LLM fails, Python fills missing fields with raw user input.  

### Challenge 3: API Rate Limiting
- **Problem** ‚Äì Recruiter summary sometimes failed due to quota limits.  
- **Solution** ‚Äì Added a small delay:  
  ```python
  time.sleep(1.5)
- Prevents hitting API rate limits and ensures reliability.
